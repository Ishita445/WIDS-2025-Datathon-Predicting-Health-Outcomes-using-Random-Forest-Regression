## ðŸ§¬ WIDS 2025 Datathon â€“ Health Outcome Prediction Using Random Forest

### ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project was developed for the Women in Data Science (WIDS) 2025 Datathon. It involves predicting health outcomes based on blood marker data using a Random Forest Regressor. A key component was evaluating model performance by comparing training and testing errors.

### ðŸ§  Objectives
- Analyze blood marker data provided in the WIDS Datathon
- Train a machine learning model (Random Forest Regressor)
- Evaluate performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Visualize training vs testing error

### ðŸ“Š Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- scikit-learn  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

### ðŸ“ˆ Result
Model demonstrated low variance with comparable training and testing MSEs, suggesting good generalization and effective feature learning.
